			<h2>What are Partials and how do you use them in Express?</h2><p><br>Partials are mini views that can be rendered in a HTTP response. They are mainly used for modularizing the view of an HTTP response. Since Jade is the default HTML template engine, this post explains what partials are in Express assuming we are talking about Jade partials for Express.js.</p><p>Partials are regular Jade templates that caters to specific part of a larger view. For example, if you want to break up the view of a page of videos, you might do something like this:</p><p><code>File: <em>videos.jade</em></code><br><pre class="prettyprint codeblock">- each video in videos<br>!=partial('partials/video', {title:video.title, artist:video.artist})<br></pre><p><code>File: <em>partials/video.jade</em></code><br><pre class="prettyprint codeblock">.video #{title} by #{artist}<br></pre><p>The usefulness of partials may not be very obvious in the above example, but you can guess their importance in more complicated use-cases. Also note, you need not keep your partials in a directory named <code>partials</code>, keep it anywhere, just point to it right.</p><p>There are two ways of using partials in Express - i. In Express using <a href="http://expressjs.com/guide.html#res.partial()"><code>res.partial()</code></a>, ii. In Jade using <code>!=partial()</code>. If you are familiar with <a href="http://expressjs.com/guide.html#res.render()">res.render()</a> using Jade, you already know how to use partials. Their syntax look like this:</p><p><strong>In Express</strong><br><pre class="prettyprint codeblock">res.partial(<em>template name</em>[, <em>options</em>]);<br></pre><p><strong>In Jade</strong> <br><pre class="prettyprint codeblock">!=partial(<em>template name</em>[, <em>options</em>])<br></pre><p>where <code>template name</code> and <code>options</code> are exactly what you pass to <code>res.render()</code>.</p><p>Wondering what's the difference between <code>res.render()</code> and <code>res.partials()</code>?</p><p><code>res.render()</code> is used to send a whole HTML page, code&gt;res.partials() is used for sending HTML snippets (mainly as Ajax response). You could use <code>res.render()</code> to send HTML snippets too by setting the <code>layout</code> option to <code>false</code>, but why create confusion? It's best to maintain the distinction - <code>res.render()</code> for HTML pages, <code>res.partial()</code> for HTML snippets.</p><p>And ... what is the difference between <code>include</code> and <code>partial</code> in Jade?</p><p>You cannot pass objects to include templates, you can pass objects to partial templates. Use includes for non-dynamic views, partials for dynamic views. If you are familiar with Flash, partials are best used as ItemRenderers.</p><p>So that's pretty much about partials in Express.js. I hope you understood how partials work in Express now. Any questions, remarks, need more examples? Ping me in the comments.</p>
